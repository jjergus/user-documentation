This section describes future Hack language features and changes that we are
working on or considering.

Some of these are almost ready, while others are in early stages of planning or
even just being considered. Each section describes the current status of the
respective project.

NOTE: This section is not meant to be used as documentation for any of the
features. Many of them are not even designed yet, and even those that are are
very likely to keep changing before they're ready.

If you have any feedback, please reach out in our
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hhvm.general/),
or for specific concerns, you can also open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/new).
